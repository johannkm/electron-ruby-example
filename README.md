# Electron as a Ruby GUI
> Based on [electron-python-example](https://github.com/fyears/electron-python-example/tree/master/old-post-backup).

This project uses Ruby (Sinatra) to serve a local webpage to electron. Unfortunately this requires 2 runtimes (Node and Ruby) at once. If you need better performance, [Proton](https://github.com/ghivert/proton) is a project to build Electron apps entirely in Ruby using the Opal compiler.

## Install and Run
```bash
bundle install
npm install
npm start
```

## Future work
- switch to sockets instead of http
